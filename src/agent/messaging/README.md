## Messages

Messages are structures sent in the "content" part of a basic message.  

Basic message is like an envelope with the content known between sender and receiver.
The messages defined here become the content of a basic message.

See [RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features/0095-basic-message)
for details on the basic message structure.
